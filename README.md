# Automobile Price Prediction UsingML
In this project we are going to predict the price of the automobiles using automobile data set

Automobile price prediction is a high-interest research area. Where predicting the price of an automobile requires expertise in that field. Considering distinct attributes of the automobile models, ML-models are trained and are used to predict accurate price of it. In this we have used three different models for making predictions. However, the dataset consists of data from 1985 “Ward’s Automotive Yearbook”. Respective performance of different algorithms where used to find one of the best suits the data sets available. The final prediction model was evaluated from the test data and the accuracy of 92.45 % was obtained.
